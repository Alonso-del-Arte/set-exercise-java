# Set Exercise Template

## Project setup

### Setup SDK
Make sure you set up your Java SDK. The IDE may prompt you to set it up in the upper right corner of the screen but if it doesn't follow the directions below.
1. Open **Project Structure** by pressing `⌘ + ;`
2. Under **Project Settings** -> **Project** -> **SDK**, Select a Java version, preferrably something higher than 8. ie. 1.8 OpenJDK

### Importing JUnit for tests
When importing JUnit with the `@Test` annotation, add **JUnit5.8.1** to the classpath.

### Troubleshooting
If you can't find project files (src directory) within the Project Files pane after pulling the repo, follow the steps below:
1. Open **Project Structure** by pressing `⌘ + ;`
2. Under **Project Settings** -> **Modules** hit the `+` button to add a new Module.
3. Select the project **set-exercise-java**, click Apply and OK.
